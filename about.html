                    <p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Named after singer-songwriter James Taylor, she developed an early love for music and began performing at local events. At age 11, she sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a Philadelphia 76ers game, and soon after, began learning guitar and writing her own songs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Recognizing her talent and determination, the Swift family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when Taylor was 14 to pursue her country music dreams. Her dedication paid off when she became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Music publishing house.</p>
