# ROSEATE
This whole website is literally my love letter to Taylor Swift because she’s basically the soundtrack of my life.
The colors, the vibe, the softness — all very me-in-my-Taylor-era.
Every playlist feels like one of her songs stepped off the album and into the UI.
It’s just a cute little space where I can pretend I’m in a music video from the Lover era while coding.
Basically… I built this for every Swiftie (including me) who lives on lyrics and delusion.
